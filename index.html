        <h1>History of Defence Day</h1>
        <p>On the 6th of September, 1965, Pakistan's armed forces heroically defended our homeland from the Indian forces. The day is commemorated with military parades, exhibitions, and national pride.Key Events and Significance:
			The War of 1965: The war between Pakistan and India began in April 1965, with skirmishes in the Rann of Kutch, and escalated in August when India launched a full-scale military attack on Lahore, Sialkot, and other regions on September 6, 1965. Pakistan's military responded with great strength, thwarting India's offensive despite being outnumbered.
			
			The Battle of Lahore: Indian forces launched a major attack on Lahore on the morning of 6th September. Pakistani troops, supported by local citizens, bravely defended the city. This battle is often seen as a critical moment in the war, showcasing the resolve of the armed forces and the unity of the nation.
			
			The Role of the Air Force: Pakistan Air Force (PAF) played a pivotal role in the defense of the country, particularly in the Battle of Sargodha on 7th September. The PAF's successful air raids significantly contributed to the defense of Pakistan's territory.
			
			National Unity: Defence Day is not only about honoring the armed forces but also highlights the spirit of unity among the Pakistani people who supported the army with all their might during the war.
			
			Significance of Defence Day:
			The day is a tribute to the martyrs and veterans who fought bravely for the nation’s sovereignty. It also reminds Pakistanis of the importance of national unity, resilience, and patriotism. Ceremonies are held nationwide, particularly in military establishments, to honor the fallen soldiers, and there are exhibitions of military equipment, parades, and air shows to demonstrate the strength of the Pakistani military.
			
			One of the most famous quotes associated with Defence Day comes from Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan:
			
			"There is no power on earth that can undo Pakistan."
			
			This quote symbolizes the determination and resilience that Pakistan displayed during the 1965 war, and Defence Day serves as a reminder of that unwavering spirit.</p>
